# CheckersEngine

Team: Franz M., John K., Jouan Y., Steven C. (MINGW64-cell)

Protocols:
- If you edit the code please make sure make your own "tweak" file and paste it there. Then tell the other group members of your changes through the GC or in person. (If you're Jouan just tell Steven to copy & paste new code)
- Any new code edits must be uploaded BEFORE 11:59 OF THAT DAY so that everyone can see your most recent code.

Summary:
This our final Comp Sci Project. Whoever wound up stumbling upon this because I'm stupid and didn't make this private, enjoy the checkers engine code.
